//Operator
//Task 10: Write a program that compare two number using == and === and log the results to the console

const a = 10
const b = "10"

console.log((a == b))//Double equal operator '==' will only check for the value except the data type
console.log((a === b))// Triple equal operator '===' will only check for the value and the data type as well
